# nodemongoprojectwork

This project is a follow along with the Pluralsight course Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0 (UPDATE) as well as an attempt of making an online shopping cart, both unfinished. I originally wanted to hit the milestones of being able to remove, add, and duplicate objects in the shopping cart and followed a tutorial, but uncountably I didn't have time to finish due to hitting the end of this course. In the future, I'm hoping to come back to this project a finish it up and hit those milestones.

The follow along is to show that I have basic knowledge about routing, the rest of the project was about adding users and authentication. I'm aware that there isn't really anything for MongoDB in both of these projects, again I didn't have time to include a database; I'm also aware that this project won't hit the full grade I just need to upload something.
